# Blog from Howard
> OK, recently I've been looking for some advanced job in Shanghai. Yet turned out, it's so important to master the basics of Computer Science--Data structures and Algorithm.
On 4/26/21, I attended the Codility test by Tesla. I think it gave me a very good lecture, that it let me understand how distress you would be when you literally can't solve a single damn PROBLEM!

Anyway, let's go back to the point. Today, I saw a blog from a SJTU guy, he's so smart and hard-working. SO LET'S GET STARTED!

I watched the DS and Algo last week, in just one week, I have a general impression of them. So here I'll paste a mindmap from that guy. I think it will truly help me to clarify my ideas.
